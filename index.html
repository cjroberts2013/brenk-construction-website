                  This is a reference for Daryl Brenk and Brenk Construction.
                  Daryl has been a vender for CubeSmart thoughout our Austin and

                  facilities. We use him for a long list of tasks, both big and
                  small. Roof repairs, plumbing, door repair, painting, power
                  washing, electrical, construction, emergency water
                  remediation, debris removal.... you name it and Brenk had

                <p class="popup__text" id="popup__text--3">
                  I first met Daryl Brenk 8 years ago, as he oversaw the General
                  Contractor building of the Sleep Inn and Suites for the owner
                  of the hotel and was quickly impressed with Daryl's knowledge
                  od construction, and the way he heard others point out
                  problems and Daryl had solutions that everyone agreed upon,
                  the other impressive are I saw was his attention to detail as
                  it really was wonderful to see that type of Professionalism.
                  After we opened we could call Daryl and he would say I will be
                  out ther at this day and time and he was always early and i
                  like that in a person and over the past 7 1/2 years when i
                  have a need for Daryl or his company, there was no job to big
                  or small that Daryl could not handle and the results of his
                  work shows in this hotel and i still use Brenk Construction to
                  date. I have a Maintenance man that has been with me for the
                  past 7 1/2 years and if I ever lost him I would have Daryl and
                  Brenk Construction take over 100% of the maintenance of this
                  Hotel. I do not write letters of recommendations for people or
                  companies and in fact while writing this i was thinking that I
                  have only written 3 letters of recommendation in 42 years of
                  business and I doubt that i will ever write another. Brenk
                  Construction is a company that is trustworthy, responsible,
                  dependable and stands by their work and word.
